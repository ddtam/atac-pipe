# scATAC-seq Pipeline

## Description

Welcome! This repo contains code for a snakemake pipeline developed as part of the project requirements for BIOF501A at the University of British Columbia. This pipeline is intended to preprocess scATAC-seq data and run cell type classification using a machine learning classifier (unpublished as of yet).
